Pair_ARA6K18YQ4UZZ-B000FP83GS,"I expected this piece of Acetal to be in clean, machine shop condition.  It arrived from Amazon scratched up and almost looked used.  That really isn't my big complaint though, I'm most annoyed the material received is not actually 1/4"" as advertised.  I'm not sure if Amazon is shipping from different suppliers, or someone just didn't take the time to measure, but the piece has "".250"" and ""6mm"" printed on it.  Obviously, both of these measurements cannot be accurate, as .250""=6.35mm and 6mm=.236"".  According to my calibrated caliper, both measurements are incorrect, as I measured 6.89mm or .271"".  This wouldn't be a issue if you're just planning on using it to make some spare part where thickness isn't critical, but if an engineering plan calls for .250"", then you are now stuck with machining the face, which takes up time and add to tool wear.","Acetal Copolymer Sheet, Opaque Black, Standard Tolerance, ASTM D6100/UL 94HB, 0.250&quot; Thickness, 6&quot; Width, 12&quot; Length",Small Parts,2011-09-29 00:00:00,Main,unit_4:::unit_5:::unit_6:::unit_7:::unit_8,A3ATQJBTE9UGYO:::A2OUE4SFMS3JC1:::A364H7U9O2GPP8:::A1E1R8IG1MHWJB:::BIW8TTGRFCE0ZA

Pair_A16IOM7V3PNJ43-B0033SHDSS,"The original versions of this item - made by Discwasher, as well as the earlier Milty versions - are great. What this accessory is intended to do is WONDERFUL... HOWEVER, the newer models by Milty are just made cheaply. They just don't work. If they do work for a little while, they tend to break down quickly. If you're thinking of investing in this product, I recommend seaking out an older Zerostat gun - ideally made in England by Discwasher.","Milty 5036694022153 Zerostat 3 Anti-Static Gun, Blue",Milty,2016-05-02 00:00:00,Main,unit_7:::unit_8:::unit_9:::unit_10:::unit_11,A2OUE4SFMS3JC1:::A364H7U9O2GPP8:::A3E48QYD5WGHXT:::AA9MSN44RNHQB:::ACWRCR0KHTY69

Pair_ARQT4BAVJQOF5-B000FPAN2K,"Is it liquid electrical tape? Yes. Does it harden eventually? Also yes. Was the shipping and handling any good? Unfortunately no. The package arrived and upon opening, the liquid electrical had leaked out of the top and all over the packaging. Luckily nothing else was in the box, but if there was, I would've had quite the cleanup. Despite this, there's still plenty left inside the container after I cleaned the jar off. And amazon customer service once again proves why they are the best. I called, they answered quickly, and the refund is already underway. Can't stress enough that amazon customer service is the best. So 3 stars for faulty packaging and poor shipping and handling service, but plus 1 for amazon stellar customer service. So 4 overall.
As for the overall use of this stuff, it's great. Does exactly what'd you expect. I use it instead of shrink wrap tubing when I can't quite fit some shrink wrap tubing in my application.

Pair_A1BCTPXWBGVOM3-B01FYFJ1CS,"I was a little iffy to try these as I tend to read reviews and read the feedback before I decide if I want to purchase the item or not. I decided to take the plunge and just try these as there was no prior review and I am REALLY glad that I did.

To say that I have an obsession with oral hygiene would be an understatement. I go to the dentist religiously every six months, and I whiten and clean my teeth on my own in between. I was looking for a new dental hygiene set that I could use to clean my teeth in between my regular cleanings at the dentist.  I love that these tools come in such a nice zippered case. Each tool is very strong and the pointed tools are sharp. I disinfected these before I tried them out. There is a sheet of paper that explains what to do with each of the tools but I had prior experience so I knew which tool worked for what and how to not damage my teeth/gums. If you are unsure on how to use please read the enclosure carefully!

I was able to easily work with these tools and the mirror to clean the plaque away with no trouble at all. These are easy to sterilize after use. I am really impressed at the quality of these. There was no bending of any sort and these remained very sharp. I like the case and that it is zippered so I don't feel as if germs will build up on them when not in use.

If you are looking to take care of minor stains and plaque buildup on your own at home, I would recommend this set. I received this product (very kindly) at a discounted rate during a special promotion. I treat each product that I review as though I paid full price for it. My review is not influenced or manipulated in anyway, and I hope that you find my review helpful for you. Feel free to send me any questions related to this product; I will try my best to answer them for you. My review, thoughts, and opinion are unbiased and 100% that of my own.","#1 Platinum UMD 4 Piece Dental Kit Hygiene Tartar Calculus Plaque Scraper,Tools Tarter Scraper Scaling Instrument, Dental Toothpick, Mouth Mirror Professional Surgical Grade Braces Dog Orthodontic",SMIAOER,2016-07-19 00:00:00,Main,unit_10:::unit_11:::unit_12:::unit_13:::unit_14,AA9MSN44RNHQB:::ACWRCR0KHTY69:::A12BAB3WKXPE18:::A11Y63SZ5XIO13
Pair_AVJC3PLM2VHRI-B01D9JG0VQ,"This is a fantastic product for it's price. I've found it to be very accurate, probably not for any highly precise scientific applications, but for mechanical work and other general use it's great. The build quality is one of my favorite parts, it has a nice smooth rubberized grip that's soft to the touch and the yellow plastic doesn't feel cheap. The back-light is bright and makes it extremely convenient, and lastly the sheer number of options and modes the thermometer has is incredibly useful (it even has a low-battery indicator).

Overall I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good quality, budget, general-use laser thermometer.

Pros:
- Accurate for everyday use
- Great build quality
- Lots of functions/modes/features
- Good price
- Nice packaging and clear instructions booklet
- Free 9V battery included

Cons:
- Probably not accurate enough for any kind of professional work requiring highly precise measurements.
- Lasers are not adjustable, they intersect at about 6 inches from the gun and this cannot be changed, however I'm not a professional user of this kind of thermometer so I'm not sure if that would even be a useful feature to have.","AVANTEK Dual Laser Infrared Thermometer -58 &ordm;F - 1562 &ordm;F (-50 &ordm;C - 850 &ordm;C), Non-Contact Digital IR Temperature Gun, Adjustable Emissivity, MAX/MIN/DIF/AVG Modes with Temperature Alarm",AVANTEK,2016-10-11 00:00:00,Main,unit_0:::unit_11:::unit_12:::unit_13:::unit_14,ACWRCR0KHTY69:::A394QKKWXBAV95:::A12BAB3WKXPE18:::A11Y63SZ5XIO13
