I've found it to be very accurate, probably not for any highly precise scientific applications, but for mechanical work and other general use it's great. The build quality is one of my favorite parts, it has a nice smooth rubberized grip that's soft to the touch and the yellow plastic doesn't feel cheap. The back-light is bright and makes it extremely convenient, and lastly the sheer number of options and modes the thermometer has is incredibly useful (it even has a low-battery indicator).\n\nOverall I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good quality, budget, general-use laser thermometer.\n\nPros:\n- Accurate for everyday use\n- Great build quality\n- Lots of functions/modes/features\n- Good price\n- Nice packaging and clear instructions booklet\n- Free 9V battery included\n\nCons:\n- Probably not accurate enough for any kind of professional work requiring highly precise measurements.\n- Lasers are not adjustable, they intersect at about 6 inches from the gun and this cannot be changed, however I'm not a professional user of this kind of thermometer so I'm not sure if that would even be a useful feature to have.","product_title":"AVANTEK Dual Laser Infrared Thermometer -58 &ordm;F - 1562 &ordm;F (-50 &ordm;C - 850 &ordm;C), Non-Contact Digital IR Temperature Gun, Adjustable Emissivity, MAX/MIN/DIF/AVG Modes with Temperature Alarm","product_brand":"AVANTEK","time":"2016-10-11 00:00:00"}]},{"unit_id":"unit_1","token_input":"GRTZTVYJVIV","token_output":"ANQEFZTBYOB","documents_number":5,"documents":[{"id":"Pair_A1IXR1SDY2JEBT-B018J40IKU","text":"Perfect - we use this for our hydrostacker.

I'm not sure if Amazon is shipping from different suppliers, or someone just didn't take the time to measure, but the piece has \".250\" and \"6mm\" printed on it.  Obviously, both of these measurements cannot be accurate, as .250\"=6.35mm and 6mm=.236\".  According to my calibrated caliper, both measurements are incorrect, as I measured 6.89mm or .271\".  This wouldn't be a issue if you're just planning on using it to make some spare part where thickness isn't critical, but if an engineering plan calls for .250\", then you are now stuck with machining the face, which takes up time and add to tool wear.","product_title":"Acetal Copolymer Sheet, Opaque Black, Standard Tolerance, ASTM D6100/UL 94HB, 0.250&quot; Thickness, 6&quot; Width, 12&quot; Length","product_brand":"Small Parts","time":"2011-09-29 00:00:00"}]},{"unit_id":"unit_9","token_input":"UQOTGOVPKUE","token_output":"OXJOWSJBINS","documents_number":5,"documents":[{"id":"Pair_ARQT4BAVJQOF5-B000FPAN2K","text":"Is it liquid electrical tape?

I've found it to be very accurate, probably not for any highly precise scientific applications, but for mechanical work and other general use it's great. The build quality is one of my favorite parts, it has a nice smooth rubberized grip that's soft to the touch and the yellow plastic doesn't feel cheap. The back-light is bright and makes it extremely convenient, and lastly the sheer number of options and modes the thermometer has is incredibly useful (it even has a low-battery indicator).\n\nOverall I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good quality, budget, general-use laser thermometer.\n\nPros:\n- Accurate for everyday use\n- Great build quality\n- Lots of functions/modes/features\n- Good price\n- Nice packaging and clear instructions booklet\n- Free 9V battery included\n\nCons:\n- Probably not accurate enough for any kind of professional work requiring highly precise measurements.\n- Lasers are not adjustable, they intersect at about 6 inches from the gun and this cannot be changed, however I'm not a professional user of this kind of thermometer so I'm not sure if that would even be a useful feature to have.","product_title":"AVANTEK Dual Laser Infrared Thermometer -58 &ordm;F - 1562 &ordm;F (-50 &ordm;C - 850 &ordm;C), Non-Contact Digital IR Temperature Gun, Adjustable Emissivity, MAX/MIN/DIF/AVG Modes with Temperature Alarm","product_brand":"AVANTEK","time":"2016-10-11 00:00:00"},{"id":"Pair_A1BCTPXWBGVOM3-B01FYFJ1CS","text":"I was a little iffy to try these as I tend to read reviews and read the feedback before I decide if I want to purchase the item or not. I decided to take the plunge and just try these as there was no prior review and I am REALLY glad that I did.\n\nTo say that I have an obsession with oral hygiene would be an understatement. I go to the dentist religiously every six months, and I whiten and clean my teeth on my own in between. I was looking for a new dental hygiene set that I could use to clean my teeth in between my regular cleanings at the dentist.  I love that these tools come in such a nice zippered case. Each tool is very strong and the pointed tools are sharp. I disinfected these before I tried them out. There is a sheet of paper that explains what to do with each of the tools but I had prior experience so I knew which tool worked for what and how to not damage my teeth/gums. If you are unsure on how to use please read the enclosure carefully!\n\nI was able to easily work with these tools and the mirror to clean the plaque away with no trouble at all. These are easy to sterilize after use. I am really impressed at the quality of these. There was no bending of any sort and these remained very sharp. I like the case and that it is zippered so I don't feel as if germs will build up on them when not in use.\n\nIf you are looking to take care of minor stains and plaque buildup on your own at home, I would recommend this set.
