Maybe even again once the next day, the plastic taste was still there after sitting overnight.  Third day, all plastic taste was gone.

I could not get the button to budge and I had to return my unit for exchange.

Well, trying to fix the handle ourselves didn't help & the mold came back pretty quickly, so we tore out the drywall since it seemed pretty hopeless anyhow. Then we discovered the leak was actually happening up inside the wall & coming from an elbow joint and beyond our ability to fix oirselves. We called a friend who is a plumber, but to fit us in his after-work schedule, it's going to be a wait. He suggested we order this tape to temporarily fix the leak in the elbow joint. Until we ordered this, we had rigged a plastic channel into a 5gal bucket that would fill every few days since it was a fairly fast drip...this tape is not only helping us procrastinate until our friend can help us, but it is also saving us water costs in the meanwhile. Very pleased with the results! Hopefully it will get us through the holiday season when our friend's schedule clears up!", "time": "2017-11-21 00:00:00"}]}]
